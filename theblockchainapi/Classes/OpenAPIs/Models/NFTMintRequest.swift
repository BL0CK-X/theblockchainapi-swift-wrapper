Processed means that our node has picked up the transaction request, but not that it was confirmed by the Solana cluster.   Confirmed means that the cluster voted on your transaction and approved it. To be completely sure that the NFT was minted, you can either set `wait_for_confirmation=True` (call takes 20 seconds with True; about 4 seconds for processed) or you can [get the metadata](/#tag/Solana-NFT/operation/solanaGetNFT) from the mint returned.

We recommend first testing on the devnet, because minting an NFT costs a little above 0.01 SOL, which is about $1.60 at the time of this writing.  When you run on the mainnet-beta, each successful call will deduct approximately that much. When you run on the devnet, that amount is deducted from a simulated amount, so you are not paying with real SOL. To get SOL on the devnet,   airdrop SOL to this address using the CLI. Keep in mind that you can only do this every so often. If you are rate-limited, consider using a VPN and trying again, or just waiting. To get SOL on the mainnet-beta, you    must transfer real SOL to this account from another wallet (e.g., from another wallet you own, from an exchange, etc.). We hope to make this process easier in the future, and if you have any suggestions, please add them    as an issue on our <a href=\"https://github.com/BL0CK-X/the-blockchain-api\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a> for the API. To get a fee estimate, make a GET requests to the <a href=\"#tag/Solana-NFT/paths/~1solana~1nft~1mint~1fee/get\">v1/solana/nft/mint/fee endpoint</a> (details in sidebar).  */
