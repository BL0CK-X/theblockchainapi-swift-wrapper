    /** This determines which network you choose to run the API calls on. We recommend first testing on the devnet, because minting an NFT costs a little above 0.01 SOL, which is about $1.60 at the time of this writing.  When you run on the mainnet-beta, each successful call will deduct approximately that much. When you run on the devnet, that amount is deducted from a simulated amount, so you are not paying with real SOL. To get SOL on the devnet,   airdrop SOL to this address using the CLI. Keep in mind that you can only do this every so often. If you are rate-limited, consider using a VPN and trying again, or just waiting. To get SOL on the mainnet-beta, you    must transfer real SOL to this account from another wallet (e.g., from another wallet you own, from an exchange, etc.). We hope to make this process easier in the future, and if you have any suggestions, please add them    as an issue on our <a href=\"https://github.com/BL0CK-X/the-blockchain-api\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a> for the API. To get a fee estimate, make a GET requests to the <a href=\"#tag/Solana-NFT/paths/~1solana~1nft~1mint~1fee/get\">v1/solana/nft/mint/fee endpoint</a> (details in sidebar).  */
